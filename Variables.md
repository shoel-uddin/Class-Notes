# Variables

## Objectives
- What are they and how are they used?

## Term
- Variable - `Names given to an unknown quantity that can be used independently of the information of which it represents.`


## Example

```python
message = "Hello World" 
print(message) 
Output-
    Hello World
```

## How it can be used
- Createing a variable and assigning a value to it
 ```python
    my_name = "Sho" 
    print("Hello My name is :")
    print(my_name)
    Output-
        Hello my name is : 
        Sho
 ```
- Re-assigning a value to a variable
```python
    age = 29
    print(age)
    output-
    29
    Since it was the initial print it prints the age 29.
    age = 39
    print(age)
    output-
    39
    Since the variable of age was changed anyhting that is to use age variable after will print 39. 
```
